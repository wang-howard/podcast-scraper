      "description": "<p>There are only so many hours in a day so you need to build a business that can grow while you\u2019re sleeping, on vacation, or working on your next business. You have to do things that scale when starting a business that will take off. While we are discussing scaling a business, there are plenty of other areas of life that you can scale including investing and video games. To scale a business means to create a system, product, or service that can generate more money through some resource that isn\u2019t your time. Scale is a concept that is meant to support infinite growth. When starting a business, you want to find ways to apply your time and money that are scalable and to shift your focus from things with a hard maximum return to things that have the potential to be infinitely scalable.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><a href=\"https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/starting-a-business-that-scales/%20%E2%80%8E\">Full Article Here</a></p><p><strong></p><p>Show Notes</p><p></strong></p><p><a href=\"http://portbrewing.com/beer/board-meeting/\"><strong>Board Meeting:</strong></a> A coffee flavored brown ale.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.listenmoneymatters.com/toolbox/\"><strong>Tool Box:</strong></a> All the best stuff to manage your money.</p><p><a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/ds.html\"><strong>Do Things That Don't Scale:</strong></a> The essay Andrew mentioned by Paul Graham.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about your ad choices.
